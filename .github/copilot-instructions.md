# Copilot Instructions for mockup-kredit-2

## Project Overview

This repository contains a mockup for a financial comparison platform (credit/loan comparison service). The project name "mockup-kredit-2" indicates this is a mockup/prototype for comparing credit products and financial services.

### Purpose
- Create mockup designs for a credit comparison platform
- Demonstrate UI/UX for financial product comparison
- Prototype for a financial services comparison website

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) for content and UI text
- **Primary Focus**: Front-end mockup and design
- **Potential Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (to be determined based on implementation)

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Keep code clean, readable, and well-documented
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic

### File Organization
- Organize files by feature or component type
- Keep related files together in appropriate directories
- Use meaningful file and folder names that reflect their purpose

### HTML/CSS Best Practices (if applicable)
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes
- Ensure responsive design principles are applied
- Optimize for accessibility (WCAG guidelines)

### JavaScript Best Practices (if applicable)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Write modular, reusable code
- Handle errors appropriately
- Validate user inputs

### Financial/Credit Platform Specific
- Ensure accurate representation of financial data
- Use clear, user-friendly language for financial terms
- Follow financial industry best practices for data presentation
- Prioritize security and privacy considerations

## Workflow Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Update", "Fix", "Remove")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters when possible
- Add detailed description in the body if needed

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
  - `feature/` for new features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes
  - `update/` for updates to existing features
  - `docs/` for documentation changes

### Code Review
- Review all changes before committing
- Ensure changes are minimal and focused
- Test thoroughly before pushing

## Development Commands

### Common Tasks
- Review changes: `git status` and `git diff`
- Check file structure: `ls -la` or `tree` command
- View file contents: `cat` or appropriate editor

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Keep the design clean and professional
- Use consistent color schemes appropriate for financial services
- Ensure good contrast and readability
- Make navigation intuitive and user-friendly
- Design with mobile-first approach

### Financial Product Comparison
- Display comparison data in clear, tabular format
- Highlight key differentiators between products
- Use visual indicators (icons, colors) consistently
- Provide clear call-to-action buttons
- Include disclaimers and terms where appropriate

## Content Guidelines

### Language
- Primary language: Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)
- Use formal but friendly tone
- Avoid jargon; explain financial terms when necessary
- Be accurate with financial terminology

### Financial Information
- Always include appropriate disclaimers
- Keep information up-to-date
- Cite sources for rates and terms when applicable
- Be transparent about comparison criteria

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials, personal information)
- If handling user data in future iterations, follow data protection best practices
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security

## Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate ARIA labels
- Use sufficient color contrast ratios
- Include alt text for images
- Test with screen readers when possible

## Notes

- This is a mockup/prototype project, focus on presentation and design
- Prioritize user experience and visual appeal
- Keep the codebase simple and maintainable
- Document any assumptions or design decisions

## Future Considerations

- Consider framework adoption (React, Vue, etc.) if project grows
- Plan for internationalization if expanding beyond Indonesian
- Consider backend integration for dynamic data
- Plan for analytics and tracking implementation
